# FSCI Data Pipeline

## Pipeline

The pipeline comprises a series of RMarkdown notebooks which process the data and save the necessary artifacts to the `output` directory. 

## Steps

`1 - Data Preparation.Rmd`: This notebook reads in the raw data and prepares it for analysis. It saves the cleaned data to the `output` directory.


## Data Sources

The data used for this analysis can be downloaded at [Kate Schneider's FSCI 2024 Interactions Replication GitHub repository](https://github.com/KateSchneider-FoodPol/FSCI_2024Interactions_Replication/blob/main/Output%20data/FSCI_2024.csv.gz).
